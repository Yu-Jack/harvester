# Harvester CRD Helm Chart

## Chart Details

This chart includes following CRDs:

- Harvester (Automatically generated by [this script](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/blob/6557fdfd178b149b2af48ca0c8274bd3234c2066/scripts/generate-manifest))
- KubeVirt
- csi-snapshotter
- whereabouts

## Introduction

Harvester depends on several components that provide the CRDs it needs. However, most of these CRDs must be created manually. To simplify management, Harvester uses an [independent folder to manage all CRDs](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#method-2-separate-charts).

That said, not all CRDs can be managed by Helm. For example, the `cdi` CRD is managed by KubeVirt, but KubeVirt does not create the CRD automatically. Therefore, Harvester must create it manually. These CRDs are applied in the [`upgrade_manifests.sh`](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/blob/50da36ac3b751c1a1dbfc8d25e5499a4c6216450/package/upgrade/upgrade_manifests.sh#L1358) script.

Additionally, Longhorn CRDs are not managed here either because Longhorn handles its own CRD creation process.

## For Developers

### How to bump CRDs

Bumping a CRD is quite straightforward. Developers just need to download the CRD from the correct source and place it in the `harvester-crds` folder.

For example, to bump the KubeVirt CRD to version v1.5.1, download it from:

`https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/v1.5.1/kubevirt-operator.yaml`

Search for `CustomResourceDefinition` in the file, copy the relevant CRD, and save it with a versioned filename like `crd-kubevirt-1.5.1.yaml`. Be sure to delete the old version.

If the CRD is similar to `cdi`, copy it to the `package/upgrade/extra_manifests` folder, and update the [`upgrade_manifests.sh`](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/blob/50da36ac3b751c1a1dbfc8d25e5499a4c6216450/package/upgrade/upgrade_manifests.sh#L1358) script like this:

```sh
for manifest in /usr/local/share/extra_manifests/{your_new_crds}/*.yaml; do
    echo "Applying $manifest"
    kubectl apply -f "$manifest"
done
```

In this case, there's no need to put it under the harvester-crd folder.
